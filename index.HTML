		According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, web development will be one of the most in-demand skills in the next decade. With 50% of the global population using the internet on a daily basis, it makes sense that tech skills will keep growing in demand. The amount of people using the internet is only going to increase.

		The average salary for a web developer in the US is $75,847. Becoming a web developer can be both lucrative and fulfilling. It is never too early to start learning to code! The computer science classes kids get in school tend to be short, infrequent, and lag behind a little with staying current.

		With web development for kids, you can turn their passion for their devices or computer games into a learning opportunity! Let’s look at some of the best reasons kids should learn to code.

		<ol>
			<h3>
				<li>It Gives Them Confidence</li>
			</h3>
			Starting something new can always be a challenge at any age. If we can overcome those challenges to succeed, it instills confidence and drive. Learning web development skills is like learning a new language. To succeed, you have to make mistakes. If you can learn from these mistakes, it makes you better at what you are doing.
			<h3>
				<li>Benefits of Web Development for Kids: They Learn Creativity</li>
			</h3>
			Being the master of your own project is always fun. You can create whatever you want to. Whether that’s an app or a game, or a website that provides something useful, there are endless chances to be creative when learning to code.

			Website development for kids is a way for them to let their imagination run wild and come up with something new and exciting that benefits them and those around them.
			<h3>
				<li> They Learn Transferable Skills</li>
			</h3>
			The importance of web development skills for kids should not be underestimated when teaching them important life skills. The challenges they face when learning to code can help them learn resilience and the ability to think creatively. These are all skills that can be used for their other school work and help them to succeed.
			<h3>
				<li>Web Development for Kids Teaches Them Problem Solving</li>
			</h3>
			Many children learn by doing. There is a huge movement in education for project-based learning. This method of learning teaches children how to use the theory they listen to in class. Just listening to a teacher lecture is not that effective for retaining information.

			If a child can actively use what they have learned for a project that excites them, they are much more likely to remember the skills.
			<h3>
				<li>Children Learn Communication Skills</li>
			</h3>
			Another of the important skills learning code teaches children is communication. They learn the art of communicating effectively. They have to instruct a computer very specifically in order for it to perform the required task. Coding teaches kids to be thorough and accurate.
